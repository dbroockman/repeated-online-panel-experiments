When using the BriteVerify API in Qualtrics, you need to specify which field contains the email address. 

For example, in the "Web Service URL" box, you will enter: https://bpi.briteverify.com/emails.json?apikey=[YOURPRIVATEKEY]&address=${e://Field/enteredemail}, where "enteredemail" is the embedded data field.
