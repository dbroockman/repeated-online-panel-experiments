This standard operating procedures (SOP) document describes the default practices to be used by David Broockman and Joshua Kalla when analyzing persuasion field experiments. These defaults apply to analytic decisions that have not been made explicit in pre-analysis plans (PAPs). They are not meant to override decisions that are laid out in PAPs. 

[HTML version of SOP](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dbroockman/repeated-online-panel-experiments/blob/master/SOP/Broockman_Kalla_SOP.html)

This document is modeled after the SOP for Don Green's lab at Columbia prepared by Winston Lin, Donald P. Green, and Alexander Coppock. That document is available at [https://github.com/acoppock/Green-Lab-SOP/](https://github.com/acoppock/Green-Lab-SOP/). Many thanks to the Green Lab for preparing and sharing their SOPs.
